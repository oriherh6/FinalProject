2. run the site by open cmd and run "node app",and then you can enter the url http://localhost:3000/static/ideas.html
   my main page is a todo list where you can add new tasks you want to complete.
   add a new task by fill the textbox and click on the "Add" button
   after adding a new task, your options are to delete the task with the 'X' button at the end of every task line,
   it also enable to mark task as done with a strikethrough by just clicking on a task line.
    ** new part **
    now there is also login and register pages
    http://localhost:3000/static/login.html
    http://localhost:3000/static/register.html

    and now you are not authorize to login if you didnt register.
    you are not authorize to get into ideas.html if you are not logged in.
    the todo list is separate for each user.
    the data is persist and stay even after restarting the server.

3. it was very challenging to implement the authorization with cookies, i had hard time to find the right headers in order to send the cookies from the client to the server.
    also i didnt know how to extract the cookie in the server but a short google search solve this problem.

    4. I found the styling of the login and register pages very fun.
