2. run the site by open cmd and run "node app",and then you can enter the url http://localhost:3000/static/ideas.html
   my main page is a todo list where you can add new tasks you want to complete.
   add a new task by fill the textbox and click on the "Add" button
   after adding a new task, your options are to delete the task with the 'X' button at the end of every task line,
   it also enable to mark task as done with a strikethrough by just clicking on a task line.

3. the client part was much more difficult to implement than the server part.
	in the client I had to keep the data synchronized with the server side with fetch requests and also visual the results on the html.
	it wasnt so trivial at start but now I think that I understand this concept.</pre>
